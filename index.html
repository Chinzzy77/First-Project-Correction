  <h1> BIOGRAPHY</h1>
  <p>My name is David Chinaza. I'm a student of Benue State University Makurdi, Course of Study; Radiography. I am the second in the family of 4 children, A girl and three boys. It is a nice thing to be a member of techsphere. I really wanted to know how to program and now I'm learning how to develop a website, I really appreciate innocent Jeremiah for all he is doing.</p>

  <h4>ABOUT MY COURSE: RADIOGRAPHY </h4>

  <br>
  <p>Radiography is a medical imaging technique that uses ionizing radiation, such as X-rays, to produce images of the internal structures of the body. Here's a comprehensive overview:
<br>
<br>
Key Concepts
<br>
1. X-rays: Electromagnetic radiation with high energy levels, used to penetrate tissues and produce images.
<br>
2. Radiographic image: A 2D representation of the internal structures of the body, produced by the absorption of X-rays by different tissues.
<br>
3. Contrast: The difference in density between various tissues, which allows for visualization of internal structures.
<br>
<br>

Types of Radiography
<br>
1. Projection radiography: A standard X-ray examination, where the X-ray beam is projected onto a detector to produce a 2D image.
<br>
2. Computed tomography (CT): A specialized X-ray examination that uses computer reconstruction to produce cross-sectional images of the body.
<br>
3. Fluoroscopy: A real-time X-ray examination, used to guide medical procedures or observe movement within the body.
<br>
4. Mammography: A specialized X-ray examination of the breast tissue, used for cancer screening and diagnosis.
<br>
<br>
Radiographic Techniques
<br>
1. Patient positioning: Placing the patient in a specific position to optimize image quality and minimize radiation exposure.
<br>
2. X-ray beam collimation: Restricting the X-ray beam to the area of interest, reducing radiation exposure and improving image quality.
<br>
3. Exposure factors: Adjusting the X-ray tube voltage, current, and exposure time to optimize image quality and minimize radiation exposure.
<br>
<br>

Radiographic Applications
<br>
1. Diagnostic imaging: Using radiography to diagnose a wide range of medical conditions, such as fractures, lung diseases, and cancer.
<br>
2. Therapeutic applications: Using radiography to guide medical procedures, such as tumor treatments and vascular interventions.
<br>
3. Research and education: Using radiography to advance medical knowledge and educate healthcare professionals.
<br>
<br>

Safety Considerations
<br>
1. Radiation exposure: Minimizing radiation exposure to patients, healthcare workers, and the general public.
<br>
2. X-ray tube maintenance: Regularly maintaining and inspecting X-ray tubes to ensure optimal performance and safety.
<br>
3. Radiation protection: Using personal protective equipment (PPE) and radiation shielding to minimize radiation exposure.
<br>
<br>

I want to be a radiographer in the future visualising the image of sick people and treating them. I want to make my parents proud. I want to be a great person in future.
